              <div class="entry-content entry-content-summary"> <p><a href="https://cmdchallenge.com">CMD Challenge</a> is a web application that presents small
shell challenges, where submissions are executed remotely in a Docker container.
I am happy to announce today that I have decided to release the entire source code and terraform 
configuration for it under the MIT license <a href="https://github.com/jarv/cmdchallenge-site">on github</a>.</p>
<p>What this means is that anyone can host their own version of the site easily
in the AWS free tier using the exact same configuration that is used for
the main production.
Kick the tires,
clone and go nuts if you want or take a look if you want a very simple
example of using API Gateway, Lambda, Dynamo and Docker. The biggest
reward for this fun little side-project would be if someone tries to spin
up their very own, please <a href="https://twitter.com/thecmdchallenge">let me know on twitter</a>
if you do!</p>
<p>Part of the reason for doing this was to explore how I could simplify the setup using terraform.
It is now extremely easy to set up and tear down an isolated and separate version
of the site. The only part missing from the automated 
setup is hosting static assets. The production cmdchallenge.com site uses 
S3 with cloudfront in front for caching. If you try this out yourself you will
need to serve assets locally.</p>
<p>Before your run the below steps it is important to know what you will
be creating, the following AWS resources will be created with terraform:</p>
<ul>
<li>API Gateway</li>
<li>Lambda function</li>
<li>DynamoDB</li>
<li>t2.micro EC2 Instance running coreos</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<b>Here is what you will need to do to create your own cmdchallenge.com in the AWS free tier:</b></p>
<h3>Step 1: Clone the cmdchallenge-site repository</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone https://github.com/jarv/cmdchallenge-site
git submodule update --init --recursive
</pre></div>


<h3>Step 2: Create SSH keys for the EC2 instance</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ./bin/create-ssh-keys
Creating keypair <span class="k">for</span> ssh
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Your identification has been saved in cmd_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in cmd_rsa.pub.
...
</pre></div>


<p>This will create a <code>private/ssh</code> directory in the repostory root which contains the private and public keypair for the instance used for cmdchallenge.
This <code>private/</code> directory is ignored by git and should be kept safe. In addition to the ssh keys it will contain the CA and certificates needed for tls authentication for docker after the terraform run.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Update the AWS configuration for terraform</h3>
<p>Modify <code>terraform/site.tf</code> with your AWS credentials. By default it looks for a profile named "cmdchallenge".
See the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/">terraform documentation</a> if you want to use something other than an aws profile</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>provider &quot;aws&quot; {
  region = &quot;us-east-1&quot;
  shared_credentials_file = &quot;<span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">pathexpand</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;~/.aws/credentials&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="cp">}</span>&quot;
  profile = &quot;cmdchallenge&quot;
}
</pre></div>


<h3>Step 4: Run terraform</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">cd</span> terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
</pre></div>


<p>The process of bringing up all the resources in AWS takes around 4 or 5 minutes.
At the very end you will see some terraform outputs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Outputs</span><span class="o">:</span>

<span class="n">ami_id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ami</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">ad593cbb</span>
<span class="n">ec2_public_ip</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">107.23</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mf">137.206</span>
<span class="n">invoke_url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">https</span><span class="o">://</span><span class="mi">9</span><span class="n">hz0doczmb</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">execute</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">api</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">us</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">east</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">amazonaws</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">com</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">prod</span>
<span class="n">test_hello_world</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">curl</span> <span class="s1">&#39;https://9hz0doczmb.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/?cmd=echo+hello+world&amp;challenge_slug=hello_world&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Paste the curl command into your terminal to confirm that everything is working:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ curl <span class="s1">&#39;https://9hz0doczmb.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/?cmd=echo+hello+world&amp;challenge_slug=hello_world&#39;</span>
<span class="o">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;challenge_slug&quot;</span>: <span class="s2">&quot;hello_world&quot;</span>, <span class="s2">&quot;rand_error&quot;</span>: false, <span class="s2">&quot;output&quot;</span>: <span class="s2">&quot;hello world&quot;</span>, <span class="s2">&quot;test_errors&quot;</span>: null, <span class="s2">&quot;return_code&quot;</span>: 0, <span class="s2">&quot;correct&quot;</span>: true<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Step 5: Serve assets</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>make serve
</pre></div>


<p>Point your browser to http://localhost:8000/ and profit!</p>

              <div class="entry-content entry-content-summary"> <p>One of the nice features of coding challenge sites like <a href="https://hackerrank.com">hackerrank</a> is that
when you submit an algorithm it will also be checked against random data. This
validates the performance of the algorithm and will test it against different inputs.
<a href="https://cmdchallenge.com">CMD Challenge</a> is a web application that executes shell commands
remotely in a Docker container. When it was initially
launched, all the checker did was validate the output of the execution
against a list of strings, expressed in YAML.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://cmdchallenge.com/#/hello_world">"hello world" challenge</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">slug</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">hello_world</span>
    <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">description</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="p p-Indicator">|</span>
      <span class="no">Print &quot;hello world&quot;.</span>
      <span class="no">Hint: There are many ways to print text on</span>
      <span class="no">the command line, one way is with the &#39;echo&#39;</span>
      <span class="no">command.</span>
    <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">expected_output</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span>
      <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">lines</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span>
        <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="s">&#39;hello</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">world&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When the user submits "<code>echo hello world</code>" the command is executed remotely and
the response is validated against the string "<code>hello world</code>". This worked fine for commands
that only needed to be verified by checking their output, but what about commands that
modify files on disk? For these types of challenges there are a
<a href="https://github.com/jarv/cmdchallenge/tree/master/ro_volume/cmdtests">a set of shell scripts</a>
that also run inside the container and will return non-zero if any of pre-determined tests fail.
This is how the <a href="https://cmdchallenge.com/#/delete_files">"delete files"</a>,
<a href="https://cmdchallenge.com/#/remove_files_with_extension">"remove files with extension"</a>
challenges and other similar ones work to ensure the bash one-line command you entered
is correct.</p>
<p>This solves most of the validation but what about this challenge?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">slug</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">sum_all_numbers</span>
    <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">description</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="p p-Indicator">|</span>
      <span class="no">The file sum-me.txt has a list of numbers,</span>
      <span class="no">one per line. Print the sum of these numbers.</span>
    <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">expected_output</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span>
      <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">lines</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span>
        <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="s">&quot;42&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>One way you can "trick" the site is to simply enter the command "<code>echo 42</code>" which
is the correct sum of the numbers in "<code>sum-me.txt</code>".
In fact, a lot of random internet people did exactly that
as you can see from a small subset of submissions that were previously
marked as "correct":</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">echo</span> 42
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;42&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;42&quot;</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;4&quot;&quot;2&quot;</span>
expr <span class="m">41</span> + 1
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="k">$((</span> <span class="m">29</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="m">13</span><span class="k">))</span>
etc. etc.
</pre></div>


<p>So the next natural thing to do is to add a way to randomize the data that the
command is operating on. Just like scripts added to run tests, now there are
bash scripts for every challenge that allow you to manipulate files before
running the command again.  Only if the output is still correct 
(and tests pass, if they are present) will
then the challenge be marked as correct.</p>
<p>For example, for the <a href="https://cmdchallenge.com/#/sum_all_numbers">"sum all numbers"</a> challenge
the script looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="k">$((</span> <span class="nv">$RANDOM</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="m">1000</span> <span class="k">))</span> &gt;&gt; sum-me.txt
paste -sd+ sum-me.txt <span class="p">|</span> bc
<span class="nb">exit</span> 0
</pre></div>


<div style="float: right;margin-right: 1em; margin-left: .5em;">
    <a href="https://cmdchallenge.com/#/sum_all_numbers"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rkqKXjW.png" alt="randomizers" /></a>
</div>

<p>Now if you type the command "<code>echo 42</code>" the randomizer check will fail since will also verify that
the command can run against the modified "<code>sum-me.txt</code>" file.
Currently, there are a randomizer scripts added for a subset of challenges.

              <div class="entry-content entry-content-summary"> <p>Have you ever thought about building a side-project for fun without spending a lot on hosting?
This post might be for you. With the most tech-buzz-wordy title I could conjure up here is 
a quick overview of how <a href="https://cmdchallenge.com">cmdchallenge.com</a> is built.
The site is a simple web application side-project that executes shell commands
remotely in a docker container in AWS. The front-end gives the feeling of a normal terminal but underneath
it is sending whatever commands you give it remotely on an EC2 instance inside a Docker container.</p>
<p>The source code for most of it is located <a href="https://github.com/jarv/cmdchallenge">on github</a> including
 a tiny command executer written in Go, the challenge definitions, and a test harness.</p>
<p>The following AWS services are used for the site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloudfront</li>
<li>API Gateway</li>
<li>S3 bucket</li>
<li>Lambda function</li>
<li>DynamoDB</li>
<li>t2.micro EC2 Instance running coreos</li>
<li>CloudWatch logs</li>
</ul>
<p><p/> </p>
<p>In addition to this Amazon Certificate Manager and Route53 was used but for everything above you can keep costs close to zero in AWS. There is no free tier for Route53 (sad panda) but it's like 50 cents a month for a single zone.</p>
<p><p/> </p>
<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Submit commands, execute them in a bash sub-shell.</li>
<li>Check the output of the command for different challenges.</li>
<li>Run tests for challenges that need them in addition or in place of checking output.</li>
</ul>
<p><p/> </p>
<h2>Deployment tools (simple and boring):</h2>
<ul>
<li>Makefiles.</li>
<li>Python fabric for running commands and copying files over ssh.</li>
<li>Kappa, zips up code, sends it to lambda, also manages Lambda permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p><p/>
With these tools the following automated steps are taken to deploy the site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Docker image that holds the challenges.</li>
<li>Launch a new coreos EC2 instance.</li>
<li>Run a fabric script that does the following on the instance over SSH:<ul>
<li>Configures TLS so that a Lambda function can communicate to Docker on an EC2 instance.</li>
<li>Executes some periodic commands to ensure that the host cleans up old containers.</li>
<li>Downloads the docker image that has the challenges.</li>
<li>Copies the read-only volume that is used on the container for the tests and command runner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Update Lambda with new code.</li>
<li>Sync the static assets to S3.</li>
<li>Invalidates CF cache for the main site.</li>
</ul>
<p><p/> </p>
<h2>Architecture diagram:</h2>
<p>There are two public entry points for the site, one is the main web-site which is static and served S3. 
The other is the API gateway at api.cmdchallenge.com which is also fronted by CloudFront so that it can
use a certificate from ACM and cache requests.</p>

<p><p/> </p>
<p>One nice thing about using AWS server-less components was that <strong>a single t2.micro instance ended up being fine for handling all of the load, even at peak.</strong><br />
<em>See section on caching/performance below.</em></p>
<p><p/> </p>
<h2>Here is what happens when a command is submitted in the <a href="cmdchallenge.com terminal">cmdchallenge.com</a>:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Javascript code sends an HTTP GET to https://api.cmdchallenge.com</li>
<li>If it is cached it returns a response immediately. If not, it forwards the request to the API gateway which in turn sends it to a Lambda function.</li>
<li>The Lambda function looks up the challenge and the command in DynamoDb and if it already has an answer it returns that. If the challenge doesn't exist in DyamoDB it is forwarded to the EC2 instance as a command using the docker API.</li>
<li>The command that the user provides is passed to a Go command runner that executes the command in a bash sub-shell inside a docker container, checks the output and runs the tests.</li>
<li>Results are returned to the Lambda function, it writes them to DynamoDb and returns the response.</li>
</ul>
<p><p/> </p>

Interested in coming up with your own? You can submit your own challenge with a <a href="https://github.com/jarv/cmdchallenge/pulls">pull request</a>. Your challenge will be added to the user-contributed section of the site.</p>
<p><p/> </p>
<h2>Caching:</h2>
<p>You may notice that when you do <code>echo hello world</code> on the <a href="https://cmdchallenge.com/#/hello_world">hello world challenge</a> it returns almost immediately.
As it is shown above there are two layers of cache, one at CloudFront and one at DynamoDb to reduce
the number of command executions on the Docker container.
API Gateway <em>can</em> provide caching but it costs money, I worked around this by sticking CloudFront in front of it but this
is only possible with HTTP GETs.
With Cloudfront in front the cache-control header in 
the response from Lambda is set to a very long cache lifetime with every request. 
The version of the challenge as well as a global cache buster param is passed in so we never 
have to worry about returning a response from a stale challenge.</p>
<p><p/> </p>
<h2>Performance:</h2>
<p>If you are wondering how well this would scale for a lot of traffic, the Lambda function currently dispatches
commands to a random host in a statically configured list of EC2 instances making it pretty easy
to add more capacity. So far it seems to be operating fine with a single t2.micro EC2 instance handling
all command requests that are not cached.</p>
<ul>
<li>Time to get a <code>echo hello world</code> response from a cached cloudfront command - <strong>~50ms</strong></li>
<li>Time to get a <code>echo hello world</code> response from a cached command in dynamoDB - <strong>~2.5s</strong></li>
<li>Time to get a <code>echo hello world</code> response, executed in a container - <strong>~4s</strong>   </li>
</ul>
<p>Without caching this wouldn't be possible and also the caching at CloudFront enables most commands to
return fairly quickly.
