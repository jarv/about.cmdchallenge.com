Just returned from an extended weekend of traveling and now finally getting to
open questions and issues on the [cmdchallenge](https://cmdchallenge.com) site. Sorry
for the slow responses.

With a few hours to hack on the front-end I did a quick face-lift and also created some fun badges.
Local browser storage is used to store state so unfortunately you will lose your progress from one
computer to the next. If people want it I could add logins but it seems like it might be more trouble
than it is worth.  New challenges are coming in via pull requests (thanks!) and I think I will move
the user-contributed ones into their own category soon. If you have more ideas please let me know
via [twitter](https://twitter.com/thecmdchallenge) or mail.

Now the back to work and back to cold weather...
